# keylogger-implementation_trial
My First shot at coding a keylogger 
I have been having trouble focusing on this for a while now.. so developement was slow
but i have managed to bring get it closer to a working model....
I still have to implement a way for the log file to reach the attacker...
I am thinking about using email for it ...
will update once i get to work on it
